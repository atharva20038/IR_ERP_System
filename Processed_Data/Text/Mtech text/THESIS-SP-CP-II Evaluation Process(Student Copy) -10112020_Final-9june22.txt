Thesis or has submitted the scholarly paper.

this option will have a footnote mentioned about the conversion in his/her transcript.
 After taking approval from the supervisor student has to email the approval to adminmtech@iiitd.ac.in for further process.

Registration in ERP


The student needs to register for Thesis online on the ERP. This is basically a two-stage
registration process mentioned as below:
>Login into ERP
(1st Stage) >Click on “Register for Courses tab”
>Select your batch/Term and click on fetch courses
>Register for Thesis/SP/CaP in multiple of 4 credits.
(2nd Stage)> Click on “Other Details tab”
> Under Project registration: you can either fetch the topics already offered by the
faculty or suggest a topic. (If you are suggesting a topic, please ensure that it is not
offered before)
> Then you need to approach the faculty to approve the same
Note:
1. If you have already registered the topic in previous semester, and registered for fresh credit
in current semester, you just need to extend the topic from previous semester in project
registration tab. No need to suggest fresh topic again.
2. After registration of courses (Thesis/SP/CapP) of all the credits in multiple of 4 cr. On course
registration window then proceed for project registration. Suppose you are registering for 8
credit of thesis, so you need to register M.Tech. Thesis Progress twice in the course
registration tab. Then proceed for project registration. If you are registering for 4 credit of
thesis, then going for project registration and coming back again to registration tab for
adding 4 more credits of thesis; here the system takes the project registration only for 1st 4
credits, so for other 4 credits you have to again do the project registration.
