Regulations for M.Tech. in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE)

1.

Preamble
IIIT-Delhi subscribes to the view that a Masters degree is primarily industry-focused,
though it can be used as a stepping stone for research as well. And the decision whether
the degree is to be pursued for skill and knowledge up-gradation or also for building
research skills should rest with the student.

2.

Program Educational Objectives
PEO 1: To undertake industry careers involving innovation, problem-solving and leadership in
Electronics & Communication Engineering and allied areas.
PEO 2: To undertake research careers in R&D organizations and academia in Electronics and
Communication Engineering and allied areas.
PEO 3: To contribute to society by becoming a model citizen, who is good at communication,
holds high standards of intellectual and personal honesty in every aspect of their career.

The Institute also feels that to address the needs of the industry, which today requires
more specialized manpower as each field is getting more complex, it is desirable to
provide specializations within ECE in the M.Tech. program. For specializations, the
Institute offers “M.Tech. in Electronics and Communications Engineering with
specialization in <area>”. But, students also have an option to do an “M.Tech. in
Electronics and Communications Engineering” without any specialization. This note lists
the requirements for the M.Tech.(ECE). The general requirements for M.Tech. are given
in Ordinances and Regulations for the M.Tech./PhD programs.

3.

General Requirements
1. M.Tech.(ECE) may be done with a thesis, or with a scholarly paper / capstone project or
without thesis and scholarly paper. In thesis and scholarly paper options, students have
to do certain amount of course work. In addition, students doing M.Tech. with thesis will
have to do a thesis. Students in scholarly paper / capstone project option will do instead
of a thesis a scholarly paper / capstone project, and will have to do additional courses. In
without thesis and scholarly paper option, student have to do only course work.
2. The overall credit requirement for the M.Tech. is 48 credits. In addition to 48 credits a
student has to complete all courses mandated by the institute [Currently the courses under
this clause are Summer refresher of 4 credits, Object Oriented Programming and Design
1

(2 credits) and Research Methods (2 credits)]. Requirements of 48 credits for all three
options are as follows:
a. M.Tech. with thesis; 32 credits of course work + 16 credits of thesis. At most 4
credits may be earned by doing 300 and 400 level courses.
b. M.Tech. with Scholarly Paper; 40 or 44 credits of course work + 8 or 4 credits
for a Scholarly paper. At most 8 credits may be earned through doing 300 and
400 level courses.
c. M.Tech. without thesis and scholarly paper option; 48 credits of course work.
At most 8 credits may be earned by doing 300 and 400 level courses.
3. A student admitted to the M.Tech. program will give his/her choice regarding whether
he/she wants to pursue the thesis or without thesis option. However, this choice can be
changed at any time during the program by suitably informing the Academic Affairs
Committee. Credits earned for scholarly paper or thesis may be counted towards thesis
or scholarly paper respectively, if approved by the AAC
4. Each M.Tech. (ECE) student has to satisfy the core course requirement. For a
specialization, this requirement is satisfied by completing all the core courses for that
specialization. For M.Tech.(ECE) without specialization, this can be satisfied by
completing 12 credits from any of the core courses of the ECE specializations.
5. All other courses are electives. In electives, at most 8 credits of “Independent Study” and
“Minor Project (Independent Project)” combined can be taken. Online course are
permitted to be registered as Independent study.
