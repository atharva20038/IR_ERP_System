Regulations for M.Tech. in Computational Biology (CB)
Preamble:
The genomic revolution in biology enables one to answer many questions in medical sciences like
personalized medicine, the etiology of diseases like cancer, HIV, etc. However, the answers to
these questions are impossible without a support of powerful computational and statistical tools
that helps to understand and uncover the underlying network design principles responsible for
these diseases. With the advent of new biotechnological techniques massive amounts of genomics
data are generated at a rapid pace from the experiments and the analysis of these data requires
tremendous amount of domain knowledge, solid computational background and strong
programming skills. The entry cost of this highly interdisciplinary field consists of a good amount
of understanding of molecular biology, genomics, algorithms, programming, statistical
computation, machine learning, stochastic processes, and other mathematical techniques that
underlie biological design principles. Therefore, it is imperative to stitch biology, statistics,
algorithms and mathematical models to analyze and interpret large-scale genomic and biological
data. Though the need and potential applications of computational biology and bioinformatics is
tremendous in India, currently very few groups have strength and capability in this area. IIITDelhi, with its strong focus on research, and already having a good faculty in various CS and EE,
is well suited to build a strong theoretical M.Tech. program in Computational Biology.
Program Requirements: In the M.Tech. CB program, the student will do 32 credits of course
work and 16 credits for a Thesis, for a total of 48 credits. The student will have to do a minimum
of 20 credits of coursework in Computational Biology. Out of the 32 credits of course work at
most 4 credits may be earned by doing 300 and 400 level courses.

Following are the core and elective subjects for this program. This list will evolve over time.

In electives, at most 4 credits of “Independent Study” and “Minor Project (Independent Project)”
combined can be taken.
Thesis: Student will be required to do a thesis in Computational Biology – there is no scholarly
paper option.
Preparatory Course: An intensive preparatory course is conducted for a month every year, before
the onset of the first semester for a new M.Tech. batch of students, which includes the following
three components: Biology, Mathematics and Programming and Data Structures.
