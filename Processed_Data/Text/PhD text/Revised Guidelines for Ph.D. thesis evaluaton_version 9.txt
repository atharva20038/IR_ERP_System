Details of each of the step are listed below:
1. Synopsis + Thesis Submission
Ph.D. thesis evaluation process is initiated by submission of a thesis and Synopsis by the
advisor to admin-pgc@iiitd.ac.in.
To be eligible to submit the Synopsis and Ph.D. thesis for evaluation, the student is required
to have completed the comprehensive exam, the course work and the research work.
2. Proposing examiners for thesis examination
Along with the synopsis and thesis, the adviser(s) will give names of at least six to eight
examiners for Ph.D. thesis examination. The goal is to have a panel of researchers who are
working in the area of Ph.D. thesis and who are appropriate for thesis evaluation.

3

Guidelines for preparing the list of proposed examiners are:
It is desirable to have more names in the panel from academia – it is suggested that
●
at least four of the six names should be from academia.
The list of examiners proposed by Ph.D. advisor(s) for evaluation of Ph.D. thesis
●
should have at least 50% names from outside India.
The proposed external examiners should have established themselves as independent
●
researchers in their research areas, i.e., they must not be working under direct supervision of
someone, e.g., like a Postdoc.
The research area of the proposed examiners should be aligned with the area of the
●
Ph.D. thesis.
Proposed external examiners should be from reputed Academic Institutions at the
●
level of Associate Professors and above.
Proposed external examiners from National Laboratories like DRDO, CSIR, etc.
●
should be holding positions at the level of Scientist ‘E’ and above.
Proposed external examiners from Industry should have a Ph.D. degree with at least
●
6 years of post-Ph.D. experience. While recommending industry experts for Ph.D. thesis
evaluation, the Ph.D. advisor(s) will be required to provide the following additional
information about the proposed examiner: Number of Ph.D. theses evaluated and the
institutions where those theses were defended.
A list of at least three relevant research papers in the last 5 years will be required for
●
all proposed examiners.
If a Ph.D. advisor forwards more than one Ph.D. theses for evaluation around the
●
same time, then the proposed lists of examiners should not be identical and should have at
least 3-4 different names to avoid any delay in the thesis review process.
The Chair PG Affairs (or competent authority) can request more names if it is felt
●
that proposed examiners do not meet the bar set by IIITD.
Advisor(s) is required to contact all proposed external examiners in advance and
●
check their availability for doing thesis evaluation before proposing their names.
Conflict of interest – the proposed (non-advisor) examiners should not have co●
authored any paper, with the Ph.D. candidate and also that the examiners are not current
colleagues of the student/advisor(s). The advisor(s) should also ensure that the concerned
student has not applied/does not apply for a postdoc position under any of the proposed
examiners before the Ph.D. thesis defense. In the letter to be sent to the (non-advisor)
examiners for evaluation of thesis they may be requested to immediately inform if there is
any Conflict of Interest with the student whose thesis is under evaluation.
The proposed examiner should not be in a blood/legal relationship with the student/
●
advisor(s).
4

The proposed examiner should not be a Ph.D. student of the advisor(s) within the past
●
ten years.
The proposed examiner and the advisor(s)/ student should not have a common
●
affiliation within the last four years.
The proposed examiner should not work in the same department and/or institution as
●
another examiner.
The panel should be approved by the last monitoring committee of the Ph.D. student,
●
before submitting to the Chair PG Affairs.
A sample copy of the form for forming the panel of examiners for evaluation of Ph.D. thesis
is placed at Annexure-I.

3. Appointment of panel of examiners
a) The Chair, PG Affairs selects at least 3 non-advisor examiners from the list provided by
the advisor(s) (at most one of which can be from within the Institute). The final selected list
of examiners, chosen by the competent authority (PG Affair Chair/DoAA/etc...), must have
at least one examiner from outside India. In case someone declines the invitation from the
first list of selected examiners, Chair PG affairs nominates another examiner from the list of
remaining examiners. The Chair, PG Affairs may ask for alternate names, if needed or if the
panel of examiners gets exhausted.
b) After the examiners have been selected, academic office records it in the file, and sends
an invitation letter by email to get acceptance from the concerned examiners, i.e., external
& Internal examiners (from outside the Institute and from within the institute). This may take
time, if some people refuse, but if not, this step may be completed within a week to 10 days.
4. Evaluation of thesis
On receipt of acceptance/confirmation a copy of the thesis will be sent to the examiner for
evaluation and report. Sample copies of the email letters are placed at Annexure-IV & V.
The examiners are requested to acknowledge receipt of the thesis. If no acknowledgement
is received from the examiner within a week of sending the thesis, a reminder will be sent to
the concerned examiner to obtain confirmation.
All correspondence and communication will be through email. Thesis will also be sent by
email, unless the examiner requests a hard copy.
Note that the list of examiners should normally not be disclosed to the advisor(s) till the
thesis review is complete; after that it is public information.
5

I. Further for Category A and B reports - the examiners names will be revealed once all
evaluation reports are in.
II.However, in the case of Category C and F, the names shall not be revealed till the major
revision has been done and satisfactory reports are received.

Only the Chair PG Affairs (or his/her authorized representative) should interact with the
examiners, once they have been selected, till the reviews have been submitted. The student
should never contact the examiners, and the advisor(s) may do so only when
requested/permitted by the Chair PG Affairs.
A copy of the Ph.D. Evaluation form to be used by the examiners, is placed at AnnexureVII.
Apart from the recommendation to be made in the form, the examiners will be requested to
elaborate the reasons underlying their recommendation in an Appendix. In it, they may want
to:
Highlight the points, which, in their opinion constitute significant original contribution
●
to knowledge.
Identify the aspects which demonstrate his or her capacity to carry out independent
●
research.
Point out specific observations made by the candidate which in his/her opinion, need
●
revision or clarification.
Comment on the standard of presentation of the thesis.
●

5. Follow up and Reminders
Admin PGC will follow up regularly with the examiners for the thesis review.
In case of considerable delay in getting confirmation/ response from the examiners for
evaluation of thesis, to expedite the case, the reminder will be sent from the Chair PG Affairs
or the DOAA.
6. Processing of examiners’ reports
Based on thesis reports, the Chair PG Affairs will decide how to proceed e.g.
(i)

If all reports are of category A or B, thesis defense can proceed.

If any report is of Category C (Major revision), then special steps may be needed. The student
may be given up to six months time (which can be further extended up to one year) to carry
out the revisions in the light of the suggestions of the examiner(s) and submit the revised
thesis to Chair PG Affairs for further processing as follow:
“Category (C)” – Additional Provision
6

i.To resend the revised thesis along with the summary sheet (received through the advisor) to
all the examiners who made the remark as Category C. They will be given 4 weeks time to
submit their reports on the new form.
If more than 4 weeks time is needed to arrive at the decision, the examiner may write to the
Institute informing us of the need for more time. If the Institute does not hear back from the
examiner in 4 weeks time, then the Institute will assume that the revisions are adequate, and
have addressed the issues raised.
ii.The Ph.D. defense of the student will be scheduled once all examiners who had given C have
agreed that the thesis addresses the issues that they each have raised.

7.

Sharing of evaluation reports with the advisor and submitting the revised thesis

The evaluation form and detailed report received from each of the examiners is shared with
the advisor by Admin-PGC as and when received. The identity of the examiners will not be
revealed till all the reports from external examiners are received.
The student should submit a revised thesis addressing the issues raised by the examiners.
Along with this, he/she should prepare a summary sheet listing each of the comments made
by the examiners, and his/her response. He/she should clearly state how he/she has addressed
each issue raised by the examiner.
The revised version of the thesis and the summary sheet showing the changes made by the
student, to be forwarded by the advisor with his/her endorsement that the changes have been
made to his/her satisfaction. The same will be then sent to all the examiners by the advisor
at least 1 week before the defense.
7(a) Timeline within which the students shall be required to address the comments of
all the examiners
The student shall be required to address the comments of all the examiners (external &
internal) within 12 weeks from the date of receipt of all the evaluation reports and
should be ready for the oral defense. The student may seek an extension for genuine reasons
like medical, compelling personal reasons, etc. If the extension is not granted and the student
misses the deadline, it will be taken as a new submission, and the entire process of thesis
evaluation will be repeated. Since the Institute pays honorarium to the external examiners,
for any second evaluation, the cost of paying the honorarium to the previous examiners will
be recovered from the student.
8. Tentative period for thesis defense

7

Once all the reports are received and comments of external examiners (if any) are addressed,
the advisor(s) will finalize the date and time of thesis defense in consultation with all the
external examiners.
9. Prepare for thesis defense
In case an examiner has not submitted the report despite repeated reminders, the defense can
proceed if other two non-advisor examiner reports are in and satisfactory (i.e. category A or
B). A thesis defense date will be fixed, after taking inputs from all examiners on the panel.
The timing of the Viva-voce should be scheduled keeping in view the corresponding
timing/convenience of the foreign examiners participating through audio/video/skype. The
final date/time of thesis defense will be agreed to in consultation with the examiners, and
communicated to the Admin-PGC by the advisor(s).
Further a final notification will go from Admin-PGC to all the examiners, faculty and Ph.D.
students. The date, time & Venue will be indicated in the notice.

Admin-PGC will forward Evaluation form, No Dues form and guidelines to conduct the
thesis defense(viva-voce) to the advisor.
10. Conduct of Thesis defense (viva-voce)
The thesis defense (Viva-Voce) may be arranged on a working day.
Before the defense, the advisor will ensure to share response to examiners comments with
examiners, at least one week before the defense.
Logistics required towards the arrangement of Defense in :
I.

Physical Mode :

●

Room Booking - by Department Admin

●

Projector arrangement, Coordination with IT team – by Department Admin

Meeting link creation (for examiner and audience who want to join from outside
●
Institute) – by the Advisor
●

Refreshment arrangements - by Department Admin

Stay Arrangement & local Travel (if required) for external examiner - by
●
Department Admin
II.

Online Mode :

Meeting link creation – by the Advisor

8

On the scheduled date/time the Advisor will hold thesis defense as per guidelines given by
the Chair, PG Affairs.
All examiners are normally expected to attend the thesis defense.
Indian Examiner – Indian examiner is expected to attend the defense in person,
●
however they may also choose to attend the thesis defense through online mode (google
meet, zoom, skype etc)
Foreign Examiner – A foreign examiner is expected to attend the thesis defense
●
through online mode only (google meet, zoom, skype etc)
A pre-scheduled defense can proceed if at least two non-advisor examiners are present.
During the defense, examiners and the candidate can join the meeting using electronic means
like video conferencing, audio conferencing, Skype, etc. However, it should be ensured that
all members are able to clearly see and hear the presentation, and are able to ask questions
when they want. The defense shall be open to all, and arrangements should be made for this
also –through presentation, video, webcast, etc
11. Thesis Defense Evaluation: At the end of the defense, the panel must deliberate and
make an overall recommendation. The reports submitted earlier by individual examiners are
inputs to these deliberations. The overall recommendation format is also the same as above
(Annexure-VII) – the category is what the panel finally decides, and suggestions/comments
are those that the committee collectively wants to emphasize beyond the comments by the
individual reviewer. All the examiners present in the orals must explicitly accept the
recommendations –through physical signature or through email, fax, etc.
The examiners are also expected to review the note prepared by the student in response to
their comments and that the student has addressed these comments satisfactorily.
If the decision is not unanimous and some examiners record their “dissent” or a “contrary
view”, then the Chair PG Affairs will decide how to proceed.
If the overall recommendation is F, then the thesis is rejected. Otherwise, the student has to
make suitable changes to the thesis, if required, to address the concerns. This revision should
normally be done within six months of the defense. When the issues raised by the examiners
have been addressed in the thesis by the student, the final thesis is submitted to the Chair PG
Affairs. If the overall recommendation is Category A, then the revised thesis is accepted.
If the overall category is B, the revised thesis is accepted if it has a suitable certification
from the advisors.
If the overall recommendation is category C, then the Chair PG Affairs will send the revised
thesis to the examiners again. The response timeline is to be decided by Chair PG Affairs.
The responses of the examiners will be evaluated by the Chair PG Affairs to take necessary
action regarding accepting the revised thesis.
9

A sample copy of the viva report format is placed at Annexure-IX. The advisor(s) conducting
the viva-voce will submit the report along with all the original reports of the examiners and
other related documents to Chair, PG Affairs for further processing.

12. Payment of Remuneration and TA/DA to External Examiners
The remuneration bill for evaluation of thesis is processed as below:
Examiner who is attending the thesis defense in person: The remuneration bill for
evaluation of thesis is processed along with TA/DA claim by Admin-PGC, for payment, after
verifying the claims and certifying conduct of viva in person.
For others (foreign/Indian external examiner) the remuneration bill will be processed for
payment by Admin-PGC after the thesis defense (viva-voce).
13. Award of degree
Upon acceptance of the final thesis and recommendation of the evaluation committee by the
DOAA, the Chairman Senate may recommend the award of the Ph.D. degree to the student.
While pending the actual award of the degree in a regular convocation of the Institute, the
Chairman, Senate may also authorize the Registrar to issue a provisional certificate to a
student who completes the requirements for graduation.
