Guidelines regarding Overseas Research Fellowship (ORF) for Ph.D. Students
The Overseas Research Fellowship (ORF) is designed to provide all Ph.D. students at the IIIT-D to an
exposure to international research environment. The goal is to facilitate a visit by a student to
undertake research under the supervision of a reputed scholar abroad (usually with someone with
whom their supervisors have collaborative links). Students getting an ORF will be required to do TA-ship
for two additional semesters.
All ORF fellows must return to the institute after completion of their fellowship, for completing their
thesis. The amount of ORF will be limited to the sum equivalent to USD 12000 for the duration of six
months calculated @ USD 2000 per month.
For ORF applications, below listed documents need to be submitted to admin-Ph.D.:
