Regulation for Minor in Computational Biology (CB)
Minor Program:
A BTech student can earn a minor certification in computational biology by completing 16 credits of
regular courses, and further 4 credits through additional coursework, independent study (IS),
undergraduate research (UR), or independent project (IP), or 8 credits of BTP on a core Computational
Biology topic, with prior approval by CB UG Coordinator, for a cumulative 20/24 credits in
Computational Biology. The program is intended to be complementary to CSE/ECE/CSAM/CSD/CSSS,
and emphasizes on the foundations of cell and molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, mathematical
biology, systems biology and computational genomics. Students pursuing BTech in CSB cannot opt for a
Minor in Computational Biology.
Courses: All courses are for 4 credits, except IQB, and require 3rd year standing or higher.
1. Introduction to Quantitative Biology (IQB): Foundation course consisting of fundamental aspects
of cellular and molecular studied by quantitative approaches as well as simple
mathematical/statistical and computational tools.
2. Any 3 BIO-numbered (3xx to 6xx) course (except FOMB/IP/IS/UR/BTP/BIOX71â€”BIOX80) as
long as pre-requisites are fulfilled.

Core Courses: IQB, listed above, is mandatory for the minor degree.
Recommended sequence of courses: IQB is recommended as the first course for the minor in
computational biology.
