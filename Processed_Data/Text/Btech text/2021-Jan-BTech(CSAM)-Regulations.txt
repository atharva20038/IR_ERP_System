Regulations for B.Tech. Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics (CSAM) Program
1.

Preamble

The increasing use of sophisticated mathematical tools and techniques in tandem with
computational tools in several areas such as computational finance, biology, e-commerce,
weather forecasting, and data science motivates the need for a program that will produce
graduates with computational skills as well as the ability to use sophisticated mathematical
concepts and tools in order to tackle these problems.
The Computer Science and Applied Mathematics program aims to develop such graduates. The
program is similar to the Mathematics and Computing programs operating in many leading
Institutions. The program has a small set of core courses in both Computer Science and
Mathematics, and many electives which can be taken from both the disciplines. This enables the
students to build a program most suitable for them. It is possible for a student of this program to
complete the requirements necessary to appear for the JRF/NET exam in Mathematical Sciences
(including Statistics) jointly conducted by UGC and CSIR, or the GATE exam in
Mathematics/Computer Science.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSAM) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document.
Program Objectives: At the end of this program, a student should have:
1. Understanding of foundational topics in Mathematics.
2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing and different levels of
abstraction including architecture and operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving
new problems.
4. Ability to use and apply mathematical and statistical techniques and tools to solve
problems.
5. Ability to abstract and rigorously model and analyze a variety of problems
using appropriate mathematical or computational concepts.

1

In addition, the graduate of this program should also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired).
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for B.Tech. (CSAM) program-the general
regulations for the B.Tech. Program are given in a separate document.
2. Program Structure
1. The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows the philosophy of having a small set of core courses
and many electives allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and
specialization. The overall program structure is given in the table below. The first semester
courses are common with other B.Tech. programs,-this allows change of discipline after 1st
Semester. Semester 2-4 is mostly core courses. In the 3rd year, there are some core courses
and rest are electives. In the final year, all courses are electives (except special electives, other
electives are not mentioned in the table.) In the program below, the placement of courses in
semester is only indicative and not a part of the requirements.

Structure of Special Electives:
The course structure allows a student sufficient flexibility in the choice of elective courses
and thus structures the program to their interest. However, in choosing electives, the
following rules must be followed.
 Special Elective 1: In this a student can select from a set of defined courses depending
on his/her preference. It can be one of the following(this set may be changed later)
○ Number Theory
○ Advanced Programming
○ Physics
○ Signals and Systems
 Special Elective 2: This elective is from the set of courses such as Science, Bio(To be
decided)
 Special Elective 3: This elective in Semester V is a choice between
○ Real Analysis II
○ Scientific Computing
It is strongly advised that a student do both courses- one in this slot and the other as a regular
elective.
List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:
https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/courses
3. Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech.(CSAM) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to 39
full courses of 4 credits).
4

2. Successfully complete all the core courses and special electives.
3. Complete at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses.
4. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits, which
are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements.
5. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
6. In the last four semesters, a student must complete at least 32 credits of CSE/Maths
courses, which should include at least 12 credits of CSE and 12 credits of Maths courses.
BTP/Independent project/Independent study/Undergraduate Research will not count
towards this requirement. These 32 credits should come from 3xx or above level courses.
AAC may approve other relevant courses (e.g., ECE, Computational Biology, etc.) to be
counted as CSE/Maths courses for this purpose. Online courses of the respective discipline
(i.e. online courses with CSE or MTH course code), if done in last four semesters will count
towards this requirement.
7. A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is optional. A student opting for BTP, may take a total of 8 to 12
credits of BTP spread over minimum 2 semesters. A student not completing BTP credits
will have to forgo the partial BTP credits earned earlier done and those will not be counted
towards the credit requirement of 156 credits.
8. A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can
count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with
satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor
to determine this) and CGPA of atleast 7.0 can take these courses.
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core
courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.
4. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSAM) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits).
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project.
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more.

Appendix: Streams
In order to allow students to make informed choices about elective courses, a set of streams is envisaged
- which is a sequence of at least three courses. Streams are merely suggestive, and there is no compulsion
on the part of the student to follow a sequence. The streams and courses listed below are some possibilities.
They may change based on the availability of faculty and student interest.

*Note: Streams in the UG programs has now been discontinued. It will not be shown on the
transcript. However, the students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area
during the course counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on
streams should also be put on the website for information of the students.
