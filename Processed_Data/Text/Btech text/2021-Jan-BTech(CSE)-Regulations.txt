Regulations for the B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering
(CSE) Program
1.

Preamble

IIIT-Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and allied
areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is to
prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and problem solving using
computational techniques and technologies, or to undertake advanced studies for research careers,
or to take up Entrepreneurship.
In order to give due importance to applied as well as theoretical aspects of computing, the
curriculum for the B.Tech. (CSE) program covers most of the foundational aspects of computing
sciences, and also develops in students the engineering skills for problem solving using computing
sciences.
Most engineering programs start with general courses in Sciences, and then migrate to specialized
courses for the disciplines. While these courses are indeed foundational for many engineering
disciplines, they can be treated as application domains (as is evidenced from the fact that most
Sciences and Engineering disciplines heavily use computing now). Hence, the B.Tech. (CSE)
program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing oriented courses first, and allows the possibility of
doing Science courses later. Besides being better suited for a CSE program, it also enables the
possibility of students seeing newer applications and possibilities of using computing in these
subjects.
With this approach, the B.Tech. (CSE) program can be divided broadly in two halves. The first
half focuses on building the foundations, and is highly structured. The second part is for developing
the skills and knowledge of the students in various topics – computing and application domains.
This part also provides limited specializations, and different students may follow different paths
and take different set of courses in it. Overall objectives of the B.Tech. (CSE) program are to help
develop the following attributes in students:
1. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of computing
2. Understanding of computing at different levels of abstraction including circuits and
computer architecture, operating systems, algorithms, and applications.
3. Ability to adapt established models, techniques, algorithms, data structures, etc., for
efficiently solving new problems
4. Ability to design, implement, and evaluate computer based system or application to meet
the desired needs using modern tools and methodologies
5. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal
6. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.

7. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience
8. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning
9. Understanding and ability to use advanced techniques and tools in different areas of
computing
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired)
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSE) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.

Program Structure
1. The Foundation program provides the basic knowledge about Computer Science (CS)
through a set of core courses, which are compulsory for all students. This program consists of
four major streams: software, hardware, theory, and systems. Besides these, there are courses
in Maths, communication skills, environment studies also as part of the core program.
2. The set of core courses are shown in the table below (courses mentioned in [ ] are electives
and actual courses for these slots are as defined from semester to semester.)

4. The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be
done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a
student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
5. In the Engineering Science/Math course slots in second year, students can take only from
the list of courses specified for those slots.
3. The Advanced Part and Streams
1. The rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one which
is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she
wants to do.
2. Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of courses
in an area providing a limited specialization in that area.
3. Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain
areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be
offered.
4. The number and nature of streams and electives will evolve and may change with time,
providing the ability to accommodate the evolving nature of computing and its applications in
the program. Some of the current streams are in these areas:
o

Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the
students may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the
course counseling session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on
streams should also be put on the website for information of the students.
5. There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
6. List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:

Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech. (CSE) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to 39
full courses of 4 credits)
2. Successfully complete all the core courses.
3. Do at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses.
4. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits, which
are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements.
5. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
6. In the last four semesters, a student must complete at least 32 credits of CSE courses.
B.Tech. Project /Independent Project/Independent Study/Undergraduate Research will not
count towards this requirement. These 32 credits should come from 3xx or above level
courses. AAC may approve other relevant courses (e.g., from Math, ECE, Computational
Biology, etc.) to be counted as CSE courses for this purpose. Online courses of the
respective discipline (i.e., online courses with CSE course code), if done in last four
semesters will count towards this requirement.
7. A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is optional. A student opting for BTP, may take a total of 8 to 12

credits of BTP spread over minimum 2 semesters, with no more than 8 credits in a
semester. A student not completing BTP credits will have to forgo the partial BTP credits
earned earlier and it will not be counted towards the credit requirement of 156 credits.

8. A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can
count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with
satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor
to determine this) and CGPA of at least 7.0 can take these courses.
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core
courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.
10. #A student should do at least one elective course from each of the two slots.- [Math

[PB/PIS/TOC] (from 2020 batch onwards) positioned in Semester 4

5. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSE) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits)
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more
