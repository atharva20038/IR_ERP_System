Regulations for B.Tech. in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE)
1.

Preamble
IIIT Delhi aims to encourage research and innovation in Information Technology (IT) and
allied areas. The objective of the B.Tech. program in Electronics and Communications
Engineering (ECE) is to prepare students to undertake careers involving innovation and
problem solving using suitable techniques and hardware and software technologies, or to
undertake advanced studies for research careers.
In order to give due importance to apply as well as theoretical aspects of ECE, the curriculum
for the B.Tech. (ECE) program covers most of the foundational aspects and also develops in
students the engineering skills for problem solving. Towards this, the B.Tech. (ECE)
program at IIIT-Delhi starts with computing and Electronics courses first, and allows the
possibility of doing science courses later. Besides being better suited for developing
engineering capabilities, it also enables the possibility of students seeing newer applications
and possibilities of using computing and electronics in these subjects.
The first year of the ECE program is common with CSE - this allows flexibility to students
in moving from one program to the other. The second year program is relatively fixed,
comprising mostly of core courses for the program. 3rd year onwards the program can be
mostly flexible comprising of electives, which may be organized as streams, including in
Computer Science as well as domain areas.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (ECE) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are
in addition to the general regulations of the B.Tech. program.

2.2 First semester courses are common across all the B.Tech. programs. All students do one
course each in Maths, Software, Hardware, Systems/practice, and Comm. All courses, except
SSH, are core courses.

2.4 The semester mentioned for the core courses is indicative and suggested, and they can be
done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite requirements must be kept in mind by a
student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other semester.
2.5 Program structure in 3rd and 4th Years.
2.6 Most courses in Semester 5-8 are electives (an elective course is one which is not
compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she wants
to do). Core Electives mentioned in Semester 5 are the highly recommended electives,
however are not compulsory (core) courses.
2.7 Some of the electives may be organized as streams, where a stream is a sequence of courses
in an area providing a limited specialization in that area. Streams allow the student to focus
on some area of ECE – as ECE is too diverse it is not possible for a student to gain a decent

mastery in all. Streams allow the student to focus on a chosen area to gain a level of depth,
and gain some understanding of other areas by doing some courses from other streams.
2.8 Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain areas
(e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be
offered. A student may also be able to take CSE courses.
Note: Streams in the UG programs will not be shown on the transcript. However, the students
may be guided about the courses belonging to a certain area during the course counseling
session conducted at the beginning of the semester. Guidance on streams may also be put up
on the website for information of the students.
2.9 There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
2.10 List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:

Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech. (ECE) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:

1.

Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG and CW credits) credits (equivalent
to 39 full courses of 4 credits).

2.

Successfully complete all the core courses.

3.

Complete at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses.

4.

Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits,
which are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements.

5.

A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.

6.

In the last four semesters, a student must at least 32 credits (8 full courses) of ECE
courses. B.Tech. Project /Independent Project/Independent Study/Undergraduate
Research will not count towards this requirement. These 32 credits should come from
3xx or above level courses. AAC may approve some other relevant courses (e.g. from
Maths, CSE, Computational Biology, etc.) to be counted as ECE courses for this
purpose. Online courses of the respective discipline (i.e. online courses with ECE course
code), if done in last four semesters will count towards this requirement.

7.

A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is optional. A student opting for BTP may take a total of 8 to
12 credits of BTP spread over minimum 2 semesters. A student not completing BTP
credits will have to forgo the partial BTP credits earned earlier done and those will not
be counted towards the credit requirement of 156 credits.

4

8.

A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits. No more than 8 of these credits can count
towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with satisfactory
CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor to
determine this) and CGPA of at least 7.0 can take these courses.

9.

A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level
core courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.

Honors Program
The B.Tech. (ECE) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits)
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more

Suggested “Streams” for ECE
Streams will evolve over time – based on trends as well as faculty interests. Some common
streams that are possible are given below. Then nature of streams will evolve with time
depending on the interests of faculty as well as relevance/importance of the areas.

3.
4.

Signal and Image Processing
RF and Communication Engineering
Circuits and VLSI
Controls and Embedded Systems

The courses in the streams will be of two types to serve dual purpose. On one hand there will
be courses to train students in the fundamentals of the specific streams whereas on the other
hand there will be advanced courses to train the students on the latest developments in those
specific streams.
The suggested courses for some of the streams are given below. These courses can be
added/deleted based on their relevance after taking feedback from industry and academia.
Signal and Image Processing Courses: Digital Signal Processing, Image Analysis,
Machine Learning, Statistical Signal Processing, Compressive Sensing, Transform Learning
and Applications, Multirate Signal Processing, Computer Vision, Multimedia Compression,
