Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Biosciences
(CSB) Program
1. Preamble
With the advent of high-throughput techniques, biological sciences are grappling with a
paradigm shift towards data-intensive explorations and challenges for management and
analysis of massive data. Apart from fundamental contributions to basic science, data-driven
analysis in biology has the potential to conquer challenges such as modeling and control of
complex diseases, management and diagnosis of pathologies, personalized medicine, and
drug and vaccine design, among others. Making progress on these frontiers requires insight
into biological processes, algorithms, machine learning techniques, mathematical modeling,
apart from numerical and programming skills.
Thus, interdisciplinary education that imparts knowledge of foundations of biology and
computer science as well as training in modeling and analysis of biomedical data is the key
to create personnel who can provide solutions to problems on the interface of computation
and biology. Knowledge of different aspects of modern biology and computational sciences
will facilitate addressing relevant problems in biology and medicine. Towards this aim, an
undergraduate program that seamlessly integrates foundations of computer science, biology
and mathematics along with training to ask data-driven questions in biology and medicine
is an important step in this direction.
Program Objectives
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Sciences as well as in Biosciences. At
the end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, capabilities and limits of computing.
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions particularly for biological

applications using suitable algorithms, data structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding of foundations of biological sciences and biological data.
4. Ability to compile, manage and analyze data to address problems in biological and

medical sciences.
5. Ability to build and apply mathematical modeling techniques to biological problems.

In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that are
common with other B. Tech. programs:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.

5. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
6. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
7. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment

context.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSB) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.

Program Structure

The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses,
allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and specialization.

C. Rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one which
is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she
wants to do.

Computer Science Electives
CSE courses that are regularly offered. These will likely to include courses like Computer
Vision, Image Analysis, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition, Statistical
Computation etc.
Biological Science Electives
 Network Biology
 Systems Biology
 Biostatistics
 Machine Learning for Biomedical applications
 Computer Aided Drug Discovery
 Big Data Mining in Healthcare
 Biomedical Image Analysis
 Introduction to Computational Neuroscience
Note: This is a new program and the structure and details of the program and courses
will evolve with time, so the list of courses and course contents will change with time.

4. Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech. (CSB) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to
39 full courses of 4 credits).
2. Successfully complete all the core courses and special electives (if specified).
4

3. Complete at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses.
4. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits,
which are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements.
5. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
6. In the last four semesters, a student must complete at least 32 credits of CSE/Bio
courses, which should include at least 12 credits of CSE and 12 credits of BIOcourses.
B.Tech. Project /Independent Project/Independent Study/Undergraduate Research will
not count towards this requirement. These 32 credits should come from 3xx or above
level courses. AAC may approve some other relevant courses (e.g., Maths/ECE etc.) to
be counted as CSE/BiIOcourses for this purpose. Online courses of the respective
discipline (i.e. online courses with CSE/BIO course code), if done in last four semesters
will count towards this requirement.
7. A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is optional. A student opting for BTP, may take a total of 8 to
12 credits of BTP, spread over 2 semesters, with no more than 8 credits in a semester.
A student not completing BTP credits will have to forgo the partial BTP credits earned
earlier and it will not be counted towards the credit requirement of 156 credits.
8. A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits
can count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with
satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area with CGPA of at
least 7 (the faculty advisor to determine this) can take these courses.
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level
core courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.

5. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSB) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits).
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project.
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more.
