Regulations for the B.Tech. in Computer Science and Artificial
Intelligence(CSAI) Program
1.

Preamble

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of technology in our daily lives, driving to
office, searching for a restaurant, getting news updates, and recommendations on social media are
all using AI. With increase in usage, there is a significant requirement of researchers who can
understand AI and build AI technologies. This program will provide students an opportunity to
learn both foundational and experimental components of AI and Machine Learning. A student
completing this program will be able to undertake industry careers involving innovation and
problem solving using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies and
research careers in AI, ML, and, in general, Computer Science areas. Along with courses that
provide specialization in AI, students will also have option to explore applied domains such as
computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and autonomous systems as well as other
interdisciplinary areas such as neuroscience, edge computing, and Internet of Things.
Overall objectives of the B.Tech. (CSAI) program are to help develop the following attributes in
students:
1. Understanding of foundational topics in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine
Learning.
2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of artificial intelligence and machine
learning.
3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving new
problems.
4. Ability to model and analyze a variety of problems using appropriate mathematical/computational
and AI concepts.
5. Ability of apply and develop AI algorithms to transform large amount of data into intelligent
decisions and/or behavior.
6. An understanding of the impact of AI based solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.
7. In addition, the graduates of this program should also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech programs:

8. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
9. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
10. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
11. Ability to self learn and engage in life-long learning.
12. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.
13. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if desired).

This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSAI) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document. These regulations are in
addition to the regulations of the B.Tech. program.

SSH Elective

The Advanced Part of the program
1. The rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one which
is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she
wants to do. A list of Elective Courses is available as Appendix.
2.
●
●
●

Some of the electives may be chosen from various domains like (more can be added later):
Neuroscience or Cognition
AI in Heathcare
Hardware related AI, Edge Computing and AI

● Parallel or Distributed AI for large scale applications
● Human Centered AI
● IoT and AI
3. Besides electives for specialized areas, electives from domain areas (e.g. health, life
sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be offered.
4. There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered.
5. List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website:
https://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/courses
3. Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech. (CSAI) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to
39 full courses of 4 credits).
2. Successfully complete all the core courses.
3. Do at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses including a
