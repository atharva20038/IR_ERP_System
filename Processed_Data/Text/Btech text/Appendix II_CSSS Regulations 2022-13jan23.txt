Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Social Sciences
(CSSS) Program
1. Preamble
The B.Tech. program in Computer Science and Social Sciences (CSSS) is born out of a
recognition that professionals of either discipline often realise in practice the methodological
tools and the thinking apparatus needed to solve many important problems are to be found in the
other discipline. This in turn can be a formidable barrier in the practice of their epistemic work.
With the growing convergence of information technology with social systems, the role that social
sciences play in the development of technology and business solutions is also increasing.
Symmetrically, the role that information technology plays in addressing social problems is also
increasing. The value proposition of this program, therefore, is this complementarity. That is,
students interested in pursuing Computer Science can do Computer Science better with a training
in Social Sciences; and at the same time, students interested in Social Sciences can do Social
Sciences better with a good training in Computer Science.
In B.Tech. CSSS, social sciences comprise of the following disciplines: economics,
sociology/anthropology, psychology, and liberal arts, communication and humanities. Within the
program, students are offered two broad options. One is to earn a major in one of the above
disciplines in conjunction with computer science. The other is to opt for a portfolio of courses
across all social science disciplines while taking the same set of computer science courses. The
program structure is motivated by the fact that the skill-set required to address social problems
can only be addressed through an integrated systems approach that requires strong synergies
between computer science and social sciences. A training in this integrated program will open up
several opportunities in the industry, social sector, governance, policy as well as for graduate
school.
The program aims to develop capabilities in Computer Science as well as Social Science. At the
end of the program, a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, limits, and capabilities of computing
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions using suitable algorithms,
data structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding the foundations of social sciences and articulating the ways in which
different social science disciplines enhance our understanding of society
4. Ability to use logical reasoning, theoretical perspectives and analytical methods,
including modelling, data collection and evaluation for understanding issues from
different social science perspectives.
5. Ability to synthesize concepts and methods from different social science disciplines and
computing and apply these to address issues relating to society.

In addition, the graduate of this program will also have the following general skills that
are common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audiences.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in life-long learning.
10. Ability to undertake research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture.
12. Understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environment
context.

Program Structure

The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses,
allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and specialization.

List of Technical and Non-technical courses of first year
For students of 2019 batch onwards

Rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one which is
not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she
wants to do.
D. Besides electives and streams for specialized areas, streams and electives from domain areas
(e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be
offered
as
open
electives.

Requirements for Graduation
For a B.Tech. (CSSS) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to
39 full courses of 4 credits).
2. Successfully complete all the core courses, and special electives (if specified).
3. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits,
which are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements.
4. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
5. For 2019 batch onwards
The students who choose to earn a major in economics will need to obtain at least 32
credits in this discipline (including Convex Optimization and Econometrics I). Of these
32 credits,
16 credits must be obtained from a predetermined list of core and compulsory courses.
The remaining 16 credits are to be obtained from the list of economics electives.
OR
The students who choose to opt for a portfolio of courses across all social science
disciplines should complete at least 28 credits of social science and humanities courses in
the last four semesters. These courses are to be opted from the list of electives provided in
the appendix, or as mandated by the SSH department.
AND

A student must complete at least 16 credits of Computer Science electives. B.Tech. Project
/Independent Project/Independent Study/Undergraduate Research will not count towards this
requirement. AAC may approve other relevant courses (e.g., from Math, ECE, Computational
Biology, etc.) to be counted as CSE courses for this purpose. Online courses of the respective
discipline (i.e., online courses with CSE course code), if done in the last four semesters will count
towards this requirement This requirement should be completed with 3xx or above level courses.

For 2018 and previous batches
A student must complete at least 12 credits from Liberal Arts, Communications, and
Humanities (LACH) group of courses.
AND
A student must complete at least 16 credits of Computer Science electives and at least 16
credits each in at least two Social Sciences Streams. The structure of streams is defined in
Appendix. B.Tech. Project /Independent project/Independent study/Undergraduate
Research will not count towards this requirement. AAC may approve some other relevant
courses (e.g., Maths/CSE etc.) to be counted as CSE/SSH courses for this purpose.
Online courses of the respective discipline (i.e. online courses with CSE/SSH course
code), if done in the last four semesters will count towards this requirement.
6. A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is not compulsory for this program. A student opting for BTP,

may take a total of 8 to 12 credits of BTP, spread over a minimum of 2 semesters, with
no more than 8 credits in a semester. A student not completing BTP credits will have to
forgo the partial BTP credits earned earlier and it will not be counted towards the credit
requirement of 156 credits.
7. A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can
count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with
satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor
to determine this) and CGPA of at least 7.0 can take these courses. These and BTP credits
do not count towards elective/stream credit requirements and are treated as open
electives.
8. Rests of the credits are considered as “open electives” and the student can choose any
courses from these.
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core
courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.
4. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSSS) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses(i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits).
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project.
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more.

Appendix: Tentative list of Electives
Tentative list of electives is given below. For Social Sciences, currently three streams are
planned: economics, sociology/anthropology, psychology – each of them is defined below. Some
courses in each stream are compulsory. Remaining courses can be done from other courses
offered for that stream. If a course of the stream is included as a core course, it can be counted
towards satisfying the credit requirement for the stream. The list of courses in each stream is
indicative, and will evolve with time.
Computer Science Electives
The set of possible elective courses for computer science stream will be a subset of CSE courses
that are regularly offered. These will likely include courses like HCI, Data Mining, Machine
learning, Natural Language Processing, etc.
