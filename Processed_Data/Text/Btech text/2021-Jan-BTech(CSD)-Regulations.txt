Regulations for B.Tech. in Computer Science and Design (CSD)
Program
1.

Preamble
With internet expanding in all spheres of life, and most industries increasing their web
presence and interactivity with their stakeholders and customers, demand for incorporating
good design using rich media is increasing in all businesses. With increasing focus on user
experience, the importance of Interaction Design and Design Methods is also increasing
rapidly in IT products and services.
The B.Tech. in Computer Science and Design (CSD) aims to develop graduates that are not
only well versed with computing approaches, tools, and technologies, but are also
experienced with Design approaches. The program has a small set of core courses in
Computer Science (CS) and in Design disciplines, followed by electives from CS as well as
Design disciplines. This enables the students to build a program most suitable for them. The
program will prepare students to work in the IT industry as well as digital design & media
industry like gaming, animation, virtual/augmented reality, user interfaces etc., as well as
allow students to take up higher studies in CS or in Design.
This document specifies the specific regulations for the B.Tech. (CSD) program – the general
regulations for the B.Tech. program are given in a separate document.
Program Objectives:
The program aims to develop capabilities in CS as well as Design. At the end of the program,
a student will have:
1. Understanding of foundations, limits, and capabilities of computing.
2. Ability to design and implement efficient software solutions using suitable algorithms, data
structures, and other computing techniques.
3. Understanding of design principles and techniques and ability to apply these for developing
solutions to human/societal problems.
4. Ability to independently investigate a problem which can be solved by an HCI design
process and then design an end-to-end solution to it (i.e., from user need identification to
UI design to technical coding and evaluation).

5. Ability to effectively use suitable tools and platforms, as well as enhance them, to develop
applications/products using for new media design in areas like animation, gaming, virtual
reality, etc.
In addition, the graduate of this program should also have the following general skills that are
common with other B.Tech. programs:
6. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal.
7. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility.
8. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience.
9. Ability to self-learn and engage in lifelong learning.
10. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects.
11. Ability to take an idea and develop into a business plan for an entrepreneurial venture (if
desired).
12. An understanding of the impact of solutions in an economic, societal, and environmental
context.

Program Structure

The B.Tech. program at IIIT-D follows a philosophy of having a small set of core-courses followed
by electives, allowing students significant flexibility in designing their curriculum and
specialization..

Note: The courses mentioned in [ ] are electives. The semester mentioned for the core courses is
indicative and suggested, and they can be done later/earlier also. However, the pre-requisite
requirements must be kept in mind by a student, if he/she wishes to do a core course in some other
semester.

C.

Rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses and certain number from specified
areas (e.g., SSH). An elective course is one which is not compulsory, and a student may have
choices from which to select the courses he/she wants to do. A student has to do certain
number of electives from the discipline.

D.

Besides electives courses from domain areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics,
E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be offered as open electives.

Requirements for Graduation

For a B.Tech. (CSD) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements:
1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to 39
full courses of 4 credits).
2. Successfully complete all the core courses, and either Maths III or Maths IV or Discrete
Mathematics or Theory of Computation.
3. Complete at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses.
4. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits, which
are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirement.
5. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards
satisfying the credit requirements of the degree.
6. A student must do at least 32 credits of discipline electives from (CSE & DES), which
should include at least 12 credits of CSE electives and 12 credits of Design electives.
B.Tech. Project/Independent Project/Independent Study/Undergraduate Research will not
count towards this requirement. These 32 credits should come from 3xx or above level
courses. AAC may approve other relevant courses in other discipline to be counted as
Computer Science/Design electives for this purpose. Online courses of the respective
discipline (i.e. online courses with CSE/DES course code), if done in last four semesters
will count towards this requirement.
7. A student may take “Independent Project” or “Independent Study” or “Undergraduate
Research” courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can
count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with

satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor
to determine this) and CGPA of at least 7.0 can take these courses.
8. Rest of the credits are considered as “open electives” and the student can choose any
courses for these (including discipline electives).
9. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core
courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause.
4. Honors Program
The B.Tech. (CSD) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as
specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely;
1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must
complete at least 168 credits).
2. The student’s program must include a B.Tech. Project.
3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more.
