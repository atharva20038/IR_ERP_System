TA Performance, Attendance & Leave Policy PG & UG

[TAs are expected to do 10-12 hours of TA duty per week]

PG (Ph.D.)
●

●

●

Ph.D. students are operated through a separate leave portal(https://leave.iiitd.edu.in/) where their
advisor approves their leaves. If the student is allocated TA work, the student has to take leave
approval from the course instructor over email.
The academic section will take feedback about TAs from faculty members on a monthly basis. If a
Ph.D. TA gets two warnings, then by default s/he will be awarded “X’ grade. This will help in sensitizing
the students who are not performing their TA duties. If a Ph.D. student gets an “X” grade in TAship in
one semester, then (s)he will be issued an “Academic Warning”.
Further, if any Ph.D. student receives 2 such “Academic Warnings”, then his/her registration from the
Ph.D. program will be terminated. Any academic warning /termination letter issued to the Ph.D.
student should also be shared with his/her PhD advisor(s), so that Ph.D. advisor(s) can sensitize the
student about the roles and responsibilities of a TA.

PG (M.Tech.)
●

M.Tech. TAs are expected to maintain 100% attendance as they are paid stipend through AICTE/DBT
and each month’s attendance of the TA needs to be approved on AICTE portal for processing of
stipend. For smooth operation, TAs don’t have to mark attendance daily; However, on the day of
assigned TA work, they need to be available mandatorily. In case of medical emergency, student can
apply for Medical Leave through the TA leave portal (https://studentleave.iiitd.edu.in/). At most two
instances of medical leaves per semester may be approved by the competent authority.]

●

The academic section will collect feedback about the TA performance and attendance from the
instructor at the end of each month. On the first instance of negative feedback, they will be given a
warning over email. On the 2nd and subsequent warnings, their stipend for respective months will be
deducted.

●

At the end of the semester, the course instructor will assign “S” or “X” grade to the TA based on the
overall performance. The“X” grade will lead to other repercussions for which they need to visit the
internship guidelines available here. As the M.Tech. students register TAship as a course (MSC901 –
Teaching Assistantship) on ERP, assigned grade will be visible in the transcript.
