Internship Guidelines (Applicable from M.Tech. 2020 batch)
1. Students admitted in the M.Tech. program through the GATE qualification channel, will NOT be
allowed to drop out of TA duty in their regular semesters (Monsoon and Winter semesters) of
their M.Tech. degree program.
2. M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) are eligible for a 6-month long duration internship,
during the course of their degree program. The internship can take place ONLY in the 4th regular
semester.
3. In case the M.Tech. student enrolling via GATE channel receives such internship opportunity,
his/her TA duty for the fourth semester will be relaxed.
4. M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) can join the internship only at the beginning of the
semester or immediately after the semester ends.
5. M.Tech. students who completed graduation requirements by the third Semester but do not
have internship opportunities can register for TA'ship in the fourth semester and receive the

Eligibility for appearing in Internships or Internships + Full Time (FT) Job offer
M.Tech. students (both GATE & NON GATE) will be eligible to appear for internship related processes
starting after the declaration of results of the second semester.
However, to be eligible for the internship interview, the below criteria needs to be fulfilled.
Successful completion of the first year (after the results and grades for TAship are announced) satisfying the
following conditions:
1. The student should have completed 24 credits towards graduation (by doing 12 graduation credits
each in first two semesters) and registered for 8 graduation credits during summer semester after
the 1st year besides successfully completing the OOPD, RM and Refresher Courses. [If a student has
completed more than 24 credits during first two semester, they are not mandatory required to
register for 8 credits in summer semester]
AND
2. Students admitted under GATE based fellowship program should receive 2 S grades (Satisfactory) in
TA duties during the first two regular semesters.

Eligibility for joining in Internships or Internships + Full Time (FT) Job offer
If the student is offered an internship or Internship + FT offer for the fourth semester, all such offers will
remain provisional unless & until he/she full fills the below mentioned criteria’s.
1. The Student will be permitted to go for semester long internship only after completing all the
graduation requirements before joining the internship. In case, a student has not completed the
graduation requirements by the end of 3rd semester, even if an Internship offer (with or without
full time job opportunity) is available for 4th semester, the offer will become invalid. In other
words, such a student will be prohibited from joining the Internship or Internship + FT offer in the
4th semester. In such a condition/scenario, the student will be required to register on campus for
credits and should be available on campus for completing the graduation requirements, if any,
irrespective of the type of credits left for completion (say IP/IS/Thesis). No request for exception
will be entertained in this regard.
2. Student must have a minimum CGPA of 6.5 as per the graduation requirement.
3. Students admitted under GATE based fellowship program must have secured 3 S grades
(Satisfactory) in TA duties during the first three long semesters.
Note: In 57th Senate, it was approved that completion of the thesis is between the advisor(s) and the
student. If a student has completed the 16 credits of M.Tech. Thesis Progress (MTS697z), then the advisor(s)
may allow a student to go for internship, and the student can defend the thesis while being on internship. It
may be noted that the student will be allowed to go for internship only if the advisor(s) recommends it.

Collaborative Thesis with Industry or Academia
Students generally get confused with Internship and collaborative thesis. Collaborative thesis is not same as
internship. Collaborative thesis is a mutual understanding between a student and a faculty, where the faculty
directly gives the student an opportunity to work on a project in collaboration with an industry or academia.
These students will be allowed to participate only in companies offering FT roles (they will not be eligible for
Intern+FT openings).
Guidelines for Collaborative Thesis:
a) For Collaborative thesis, a student has to be in the campus for 1st three regular semesters (with
regular TA work, if admitted through GATE seats) and need to complete the course work (32
credits+ OOPD/RM + Summer refresher). S/he will only be allowed to work from outside campus, if
s/he has completed the coursework. S/he will only be allowed to take thesis credit while working
from outside campus. A student may plan to compete part of thesis credit within campus and
remaining part outside campus in the collaborated organization in consultation with the IIITD
supervisor.
b) Such students should take necessary approvals from the advisor and academic office before
starting their work. The student has to submit the approval of the supervisor to the academic at
least one week before the list of eligible students for internship+FT offer is submitted to placement
office, so that they will be excluded from the list which will be sent to the placement who are
eligible to sit for intern+FT offer.
c) For a collaborative thesis, students will be allowed to work only with those industry/academia
involved in the joint supervision of the thesis.
d) A regular thesis cannot be converted to a collaborative thesis.

Process to be followed
Following process will be followed for Internship and Collaborative Thesis;
a)

The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Winter semester results, by 20th of June every year. The placement office will allow
only such students to participate for an internship opening.

b)

The academic office will share the list of eligible students with the placement office after the
declaration of Sem 3 results i.e. by 20th January (this will be a sub-list of the list shared as per pnt
(a). The placement office will allow only such students to join their internship.

c)

After the completion of M.Tech. program, those who have existing offers (Fulltime offers,06
months Internship+ FT, Only 06 months Internship) do have the option to choose their degree
date.

d)

Students who do not have existing offers & are willing to go for 06/11-month internship in
Semester 4 and 5 can ask for an extension in degree date and can choose their degree date. All
other internship rules, as stated above such as “completing the credits by 3rd semester etc.” will
be applicable to them.
