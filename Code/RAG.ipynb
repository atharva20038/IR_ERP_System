Preamble \\n \\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of technology in our daily lives, driving to office, searching for a restaurant, getting news updates, and recommendations on social media are all using AI. With increase in usage, there is a significant requirement of researchers who can understand AI and build AI technologies. This program will provide students an opportunity to learn both foundational and experimental components of AI and Machine Learning. A student completing this program will be able to undertake industry careers involving innovation and problem solving using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies and research careers in AI, ML, and, in general, Computer Science areas. Along with courses that provide specialization in AI, students will also have option to explore applied domains such as computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and autonomous systems as well as other interdisciplinary areas such as neuroscience, edge computing, and Internet of Things. \\n Overall objectives of the B.Tech. (CSAI) program are to help develop the following attributes in students:  \\n1. Understanding of foundational topics in Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning. \\n2. Understanding of theoretical foundations and limits of artificial intelligence and machine learning. \\n3. Ability to design and implement algorithms and data structures for efficiently solving new problems. \\n4. Ability to model and analyze a variety of problems using appropriate mathematical/computational and AI concepts. \\n5. Ability of apply and develop AI algorithms to transform large amount of data into intelligent decisions and/or behavior. \\n6. An understanding of the impact of AI based solutions in an economic, societal, and environment context. \\n7. In addition, the graduates of this program should also have the following general skills that are common with other B.Tech programs: \\n8. Ability to function effectively in teams to accomplish a common goal. \\n9. An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility. \\n10. Ability to communicate effectively with a wide range of audience. \\n11. Ability to self learn and engage in life-long learning. \\n12. Ability to undertake small research tasks and projects. \\n13.

The rest of the program consists mostly of elective courses. An elective course is one which is not compulsory, and a student may have choices from which to select the courses he/she wants to do. A list of Elective Courses is available as Appendix. \\n \\n2. Some of the electives may be chosen from various domains like (more can be added later): ? Neuroscience or Cognition \\n? AI in Heathcare \\n? Hardware related AI, Edge Computing and AI \\n? Parallel or Distributed AI for large scale applications \\n? Human Centered AI \\n? IoT and AI \\n \\n3. Besides electives for specialized areas, electives from domain areas (e.g. health, life sciences, finance, economics, E-Governance, sciences, etc.) may also be offered. \\n \\n4. There will also be a set of Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH) courses offered. \\n \\n5. List of courses, and further information about the courses is available on the website: \\nhttps://www.iiitd.ac.in/academics/courses \\n \\n \\n3. Requirements for Graduation \\n \\nFor a B.Tech. (CSAI) degree, a student must satisfy all the following requirements: \\n \\n1. Earn a total of 156 (inclusive of 2 credits each of SG/CW credits) credits (equivalent to 39 full courses of 4 credits). \\n \\n2. Successfully complete all the core courses. \\n \\n3. Do at least 12 credits of Social Science and Humanities (SSH) Courses including a mandatory SSH course, Ethics in AI. Refer Appendix I for list of courses. \\n \\n4. Do 2 credits of Community Work and Self Growth each. These are pass/fail credits, which are required to be completed, and will count for fulfilling the credit requirements. \\n5. Successfully complete all core courses listed in the above table. \\n \\n6. Earn 8 credits of additional CS core courses(from the courses marked as * in the above table other than Ethics in AI course, which is a SSH course) and 4 credits of Maths Elective Courses (from the courses marked as # in the above table). Refer Appendix I for list of courses. \\n \\n7. Earn 8 credits of additional AI core courses from list of courses and 16 credits of AI application electives available at Appendix I. These credits should come from 3xx or above level courses. \\n \\n8. A student may take Online Courses. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. \\n \\n9. A B.Tech. Project (BTP) is optional. A student opting for BTP, may take a total of 8 to 12 credits of BTP spread over minimum 2 semesters, with no more than 8 credits in a semester. A student not completing BTP credits will have to forgo the partial BTP credits earned earlier and it will not be counted towards the credit requirement of 156 credits. \\n10. A student may take \"Independent Project\" or \"Independent Study\" or \"Undergraduate Research\" courses for 1, 2, or 4 credits in a semester. No more than 8 of these credits can count towards satisfying the credit requirements of the degree. Only students with satisfactory CGPA (at least 7.5) or with a strong interest in some area (the faculty advisor to determine this) and CGPA of at least 7.0 can take these courses. \\n \\n11. A student can take maximum 2, 2xx level courses in 3rd and 4th year. The 2xx level core courses listed in Semester 5 or later will not count towards this clause. \\n \\n \\n4. Honors Program \\n \\nThe B.Tech. (CSAI) program has the Honors option, requirements for which are same as specified in the regulations for the B.Tech. program. Namely; \\n \\n1. The student must earn an additional 12 discipline credits from in-class courses (i.e. must complete at least 168 credits) \\n2. The student\\'s program must include a B.Tech. Project \\n3. At graduation time, the student must have a CGPA of 8.0 or more \\n \\n \\nAppendix I: Tentative list of Electives \\n \\nA.
